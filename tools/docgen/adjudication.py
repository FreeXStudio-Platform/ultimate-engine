"""Active L10/L11 adjudication — CONSULT the governance matrices, don't just check they exist.

Until now the engine only verified that ``CONTRADICTION.md`` (RULEBOOK L11 tie-breaker table)
and ``update_impact_map.json`` (RULEBOOK L10 change-type -> dependent-docs + sanitization) EXIST
and PARSE. This module upgrades that to **active consultation** (the ENGINE_PLAN §4b item deferred
to ``docs/process/OPEN_GATES.md``):

* ``load_contradictions`` / ``annotate_with_contradictions`` — when a gate finding fires, look the
  relevant tie-breaker up in ``CONTRADICTION.md`` and attach its recorded resolution as an
  **advisory (non-blocking) INFO finding**, so an operator sees *how the rulebook already resolved
  this recurring conflict* instead of re-deriving it ad hoc. This is purely additive: it never
  changes ``GateResult.ok`` (no advisory INFO is ``blocking``), never drops or mutates an existing
  finding, and never relaxes a hard block. The precedence spine (``export_sanitizer.adjudicate``)
  still governs the hard ordering; this layer explains, it does not override.

* ``load_impact_map`` / ``compute_change_impact`` — given a change type
  (``DETECTOR_CHANGE`` / ``VISUAL_STYLE_CHANGE`` / ``USER_POLICY_CHANGE`` /
  ``ARCHITECTURE_CHANGE`` / ``RULE_CHANGE``), consult ``update_impact_map.json`` and return the
  dependent doc-id prefixes that must be reviewed plus the public-sanitization rule to apply —
  the actual L10 blast-radius answer, read from the map rather than treated as a mere file that
  exists.

**Fail-open by contract** (these are advisory governance aids layered on top of the hard gates —
they must NEVER be able to *block* a build that the leak-gate itself passed, nor *pass* one it
blocked). A missing/unreadable/malformed matrix degrades gracefully: the consultation returns an
empty result and logs a WARNING via ``logging`` — it is never faked and never silently swallowed
into a false "consulted OK". The hard blocking moat lives entirely in ``export_sanitizer`` and is
unaffected by anything here.
